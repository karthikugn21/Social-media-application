   ```bash
   cd mern-social-media-app/backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory to store environment variables (like MongoDB URI, JWT_SECRET, etc.).

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

### Running the App with Docker

1. Build and run the app using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will set up the frontend and backend containers and run them together.

2. Visit the app on:

   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project is integrated with Jenkins to automate the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) process.

- **CI Pipeline**: The CI pipeline is configured to automatically build and test the app whenever there is a change in the GitHub repository.
- **CD Pipeline**: After a successful build, the app is deployed to AWS EC2.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on **AWS EC2** using **Docker** and **Jenkins** for automated deployment.

- The backend runs on port `5000`.
- The frontend runs on port `3000`.
